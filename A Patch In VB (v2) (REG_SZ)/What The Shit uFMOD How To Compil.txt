So, you want to use uFMOD in your VB6 application?  You'll need to complete the
following steps:

1. You need to include uF_vb.bas (WINMM version) or  DSuF_vb.bas (DirectX) into
   your project. Do not rename this file. Do not modify it's contents. Place it
   into the  main  directory  of  your project. Place ufmod.lib (WINMM version)
   or dsufmod.lib (DirectX) into the same location as uF_vb.bas or DSuF_vb.bas.
   Copy the DirectSound type library dsound.tlb to the same location when using
   the DirectX version.

2. Target type should be native EXE. No p-code!

3. Find the directory where VB6.EXE is installed (i.e. \Program Files\Microsoft
   Visual Studio\VB98\). Rename LINK.EXE to LNK.EXE. Copy the included link.exe
   file into that directory. Full source code is included.  The modified linker
   is able to build any application:  with or without  uFMOD.  Though,  you may
   restore the original linker from LNK.EXE whenever you want to.

uFMOD is able to play  files, resources and static memory arrays.  No practical
way exists of using  memory arrays in VB6.  Actually there is an example in the
official  uFMOD forum, but it uses too much  overhead memory and is more like a
proof of concept  than a real  example. So, if you  want to embedd  an XM track
directly in the EXE, you'd better use resources like the included examples do.

That's all!
