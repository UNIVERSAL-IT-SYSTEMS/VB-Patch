---[ Optimise your patch ]

-> Pack your patch with UPX
-> Try to reduce your .bmp filesize
-> Make a stand-alone executable (yeah that possible)

You know has Visual Basic use some OCX, on this patch the problem was "ComDlg32.OCX"
If you dont have it, you got an error:
"Component 'COMDLG32.OCX' or one of its dependencies not correctly registered: a file is missing or invalid"
There is a solution for that, a shareware: PGWARE - Alloy 4

I leave you here a description:
Alloy 4 gives software developer's the ability to distribute stand-alone executables.
Alloy is a remarkable product which takes the hassle out of distributing software without separate runtime files.
Very easy to use, fully compliant with Visual C++, Delphi, Visual Basic and many other programming languages.
With Alloy your software products are much more reliable and compact for distribution.
